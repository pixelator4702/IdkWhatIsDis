	<h3>Hello, this is just a random website that I made because why not.</h3>
	<br>
	<h1>Things about myself</h1>
	<h3>I'm a pixel player and I don't know what else to say so here's an image or a gif if you want to call it that although I think that might just be some animated image to be honest and I don't really understand it so yeah that's my opinion about these "gifs" although I think they are not. Also, how do you pronounce "gif"? Do you pronouce it like "gift" or "jif"? I personally think that pronouncing "gif" as "gift" and thus I think that if you pronounce the word "gif" as "jif" you are bad at english. No offence, but like, you probably can't pronounce "vase" properly just like some american person who decided to be "special" in their own eyes but they aren't.</h3>
